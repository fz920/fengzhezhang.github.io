I served as a Peer Tutor and Teaching Assistant at Imperial College London from October 2022 to April 2023, supporting students across multiple mathematics courses.

## First-Year Student Support

Led group tutorials for first-year students covering fundamental mathematical concepts:

* **Probability**: Guided students through probability theory fundamentals, including discrete and continuous distributions, expectation, and variance
* **Analysis**: Taught rigorous mathematical analysis concepts including limits, continuity, and convergence
* **Calculus**: Provided instruction in differential and integral calculus with applications

The tutorials focused on advanced mathematical problem-solving techniques to enhance academic understanding and performance. I worked closely with students to develop their mathematical reasoning skills and build confidence in tackling complex problems.

## Second-Year Student Support

Provided specialized support for second-year students in the **Numerical Analysis** module:

* **Julia Programming**: Offered guidance in Julia programming language for computational mathematics
* **Computational Methods**: Helped students understand numerical algorithms and their implementation
* **Mathematical Software**: Fostered deeper understanding of computational tools for mathematical analysis

This role allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical computational applications, helping students develop both mathematical intuition and programming skills necessary for advanced mathematical modeling.

## Skills Developed

Through this teaching experience, I developed:

* **Communication Skills**: Ability to explain complex mathematical concepts clearly to diverse audiences
* **Problem-Solving Guidance**: Techniques for helping students develop independent problem-solving approaches
* **Educational Technology**: Experience with mathematical software and computational tools
* **Student Support**: Understanding of different learning styles and adaptation of teaching methods accordingly
