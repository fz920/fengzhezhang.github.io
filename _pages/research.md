## Research Philosophy

My research is driven by the belief that **theoretical rigor and practical impact** should go hand in hand. I focus on developing probabilistic generative models that not only advance our fundamental understanding of machine learning but also solve real-world problems in computational chemistry and scientific discovery.

## Current Research Program

### Efficient Sampling from Complex Distributions

My primary research focuses on developing **efficient and unbiased sampling methods** for complex probability distributions, particularly those arising in computational chemistry and molecular modeling. This work addresses fundamental challenges in:

- **Molecular Generation**: Creating novel molecular structures for drug discovery
- **Materials Science**: Designing materials with specific properties  
- **Statistical Physics**: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions in high-dimensional spaces

### Methodological Contributions

**Variance-Tuned Diffusion Models**: I am developing novel diffusion models that incorporate variance tuning to achieve both computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of unbiased sampling. This work has applications in:
- Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations
- Drug discovery pipelines  
- Materials design optimization

**Consistency Models for Scientific Computing**: My MPhil dissertation introduced a framework combining consistency models with importance sampling, achieving **≈4× computational speedup** while maintaining unbiased estimates from molecular energy functions.

## Future Research Directions

### 1. Foundation Models for Scientific Discovery
I aim to develop **large-scale foundation models** specifically designed for scientific applications, particularly in chemistry and materials science. These models would:
- Incorporate physical constraints and conservation laws
- Provide uncertainty quantification for scientific predictions
- Enable few-shot learning for new molecular systems

### 2. Theoretical Guarantees for Generative Models  
I plan to advance the theoretical understanding of generative models by:
- Developing convergence analysis for diffusion models in high-dimensional spaces
- Establishing sample complexity bounds for molecular generation tasks
- Creating robust evaluation metrics for scientific generative models

### 3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
I seek to bridge machine learning and computational sciences through:
- Collaboration with chemists and materials scientists
- Development of domain-specific benchmarks and datasets
- Translation of theoretical advances into practical scientific tools

## Research Impact & Vision

My long-term vision is to **democratize computational chemistry** through machine learning, making sophisticated molecular modeling accessible to researchers without extensive computational resources. By developing efficient and theoretically grounded methods, I aim to:

- **Accelerate drug discovery** by reducing computational costs of molecular simulation
- **Enable novel materials design** through efficient exploration of chemical space  
- **Advance scientific understanding** of complex molecular systems

## Collaborative Approach

I believe the most impactful research emerges from **interdisciplinary collaboration**. My experience working with computational chemists, statisticians, and machine learning researchers has shaped my appreciation for:
- The importance of domain expertise in developing meaningful methods
- The need for robust evaluation on real scientific problems
- The value of open science and reproducible research practices
