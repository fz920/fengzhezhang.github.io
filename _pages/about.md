Welcome! I'm Fengzhe Zhang, a Machine Learning Researcher specializing in **Probabilistic Generative Models** with applications to computational chemistry and molecular generation. I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at the **University of Cambridge** under the supervision of Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, where I develop cutting-edge deep learning methods for scientific computing.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on developing efficient and theoretically grounded deep generative models for scientific applications, particularly in computational chemistry and molecular generation. My work bridges the gap between machine learning theory and practical scientific computing:

### **Core Research Areas:**
* **🧬 Diffusion Models for Molecular Generation**: Developing efficient and unbiased sampling methods from Boltzmann distributions with applications in drug discovery and materials science
* **⚡ Consistency Models**: Creating novel frameworks for accelerated molecular energy function sampling that achieve 4× speedup over traditional methods
* **🌊 Normalizing Flows**: Applying flow-based models to molecular generation and density estimation problems
* **🎯 Variational Methods**: Improving training dynamics and representation learning in variational autoencoders

### **Methodological Focus:**
* Variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo sampling
* Unbiased estimators for computational chemistry applications  
* Theoretical analysis of convergence properties in generative models
