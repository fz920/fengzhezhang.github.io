Welcome! I'm Fengzhe Zhang, a Machine Learning Researcher specializing in Probabilistic Generative Models. I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on developing and applying deep generative models to accelerate molecular generation and improve sampling accuracy. I'm particularly interested in:

* **Diffusion Models**: Developing efficient and unbiased sampling methods from Boltzmann distributions
* **Consistency Models**: Creating frameworks for molecular energy function sampling
* **Normalizing Flows**: Applying flow-based models to molecular generation
* **Variational Autoencoders**: Improving training dynamics and representation learning

Education
======
I completed my **MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence** at the University of Cambridge (2023-2024), achieving a Distinction with a score of 79.87%, ranking in the top 10% of my cohort. 

Prior to that, I earned my **BSc in Mathematics** from Imperial College London (2020-2023) with First Class Honours, scoring 88.41% and ranking in the top 4% (10th out of 251 students).

Recent Work
======
My current research involves developing variance-tuned diffusion models for efficient and unbiased sampling from Boltzmann distributions, which has applications in molecular generation and computational chemistry. My MPhil dissertation focused on creating a Consistency-Model framework combined with importance sampling that yields unbiased samples from molecular energy functions, achieving approximately 4× speedup compared to DDPM baselines.
